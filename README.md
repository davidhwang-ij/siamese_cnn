# Clustering Screenshots of Malicious Web Pages on Siamese Convolutional Neural Network

A clustering system with Siamese Neural Network and Density-based Spatial Clustering (DBSCAN) to group screenshots of malicious web pages based on their semantic similarities so that different sets of similar malicious web pages belonging to different social engineering attack campaigns can be identified.
